# visual-modeller-core

A web-based approach to the interactive visualisation of system models. 

This repo contains the generic framework, including base classes for the key objects: `Model`, `Node`, `Socket`, `Link` and `Log`, as well as the code for interactive visualisation

Code for specific types of model builds on this framework. See, for example, [visual-modeller-energy](https://github.com/grahampullan/visual-modeller-energy).
